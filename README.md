# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

Taking steps to learn the math and intuition behind machine learning models. 
NB: Notes for Week 3 and 4 of Advanced Algorithms are not complete, TBC

The table of contents and formatting will look a little wonky as I'ved used a Notion PDF batch exporter from https://github.com/ganeshh123/notion-pdf-export.

All image materials are from Andrew Ng's Introduction to Machine Learning course.
Notes are written by me.
